### Problem Statement: Predicting cancer cases and no-cancer cases.
Data Description
Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei.

## Attribute Information:
<br> Real-valued features are computed for three cell nucleus that are mean, se, worst
<br>a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) 
<br>b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values) 
<br>c) perimeter 
<br>d) area 
<br>e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths) 
<br>f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) 
<br>g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour) 
<br>h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour) 
<br>i) symmetry 
<br>j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
